# What is ACE?
"ACE" - Accumulated Cyclone Energy = An index that combines the numbers of systems, how long they existed and how intense they became. It is calculated by squaring the maximum sustained surface wind in the system every six hours that the cyclone is a Named Storm and summing it up for the season.

It is expressed in 10 to the 4th kt**2.
